# The Watch and the Twelve Realms  
(read the first watch story at jimishol.github.io/post/diatonic)

The boy was on the cusp of manhood, with the restless energy of youth still clinging to him. He stood in the dim, echoing hall, waiting for his turn before the High Priest of the Temple of Music.

A sheen of sweat traced his brow — not from heat, but from the tightening coil of anticipation. He was deft with his hands, a craftsman by nature, yet music was his quiet, unwavering passion, despite knowing nothing of its theories or the temple’s sacred laws.

When word drifted through the streets that a new deacon was sought, the call was impossible to resist. Now he inched forward with the slow patience of the devoted. His eyes fixed on the great doors ahead. Each time they opened, another hopeful would emerge, gaze low, expression shadowed by failure.

The trials, whispered those in line, were sharp and sudden — questions that demanded not just an answer, but one given without a heartbeat’s pause.

As the moments slipped by, the boy felt his own pulse loud in his ears, his palms damp, the truth pressing in on him: he had no knowledge to offer, only the will to stand here and try.

The great doors yawned wide, and the boy stepped into the chamber.  
The High Priest sat slouched in his high seat, his eyes heavy with the weariness of too many auditions. A flicker of impatience passed across his face — until his gaze caught on the watch strapped to the boy’s right wrist.

“Where did you get that watch?” he asked.

“It’s a family heirloom,” the boy replied. “My grandfather made it himself. He was a famed craftsman in his time, and he gave it to me, saying I had the same gift in my hands that he once possessed.”

The Priest gave a doubtful hum. “Perhaps. But here you will be tested for your knowledge and your devotion to music.”

---

His eyes drifted once more from the watch to the boy’s face — and for a moment, the brass‑ringed dial seemed to hold the air itself still.

The Priest’s gaze locked onto him. “Tell me, boy… what time gathers four flats?”

The words struck like the snap of a trigger. Four flats. The boy’s mind jerked to the watch: a glint of metal, the crisp markings — and there it was, the tiny ♭. In music, a flat. But here, on this watch, **b** meant 5. It was written right on the face: *b = 5*.

Four times five. Twenty: eight at night. Too simple. And yet… the weight in the Priest’s voice carried another meaning — a coded language where keys and signatures set the terms, and numbers were only half the truth.

At eight o’clock on this dial, A♭ major lived in place of the hour.

“It will be A♭ major, Father,” he said — hesitant, as though the answer might still turn to smoke between them.

“Correct,” the Priest said. “But if you’d been any slower, you’d be back where you came from, boy. Don’t stall over something so simple. Now — your last reply is not yet secure; answer swiftly, if you wish to go on to the final test — what time gathers three sharps?”

---

No hesitation this time. The Priest clearly treated scales as time. Three sharps. On this watch, **# = 7** — it was etched into his mind as surely as the brass rim around the dial. Three times seven… twenty‑one: nine o’clock.

“A major, Father,” he said, the answer crisp, his voice steady.

The Priest’s lips curved — not in warmth, but in a way that suggested the tests were not over yet.

“Who gathers at E major, boy?”

E major… four o’clock. No multiple of 5 or 7. The boy understood that on every watch, time repeats every twelve hours. He had no time to think. Instinct took over — he began adding twelves: 4, 16, 28. Yes! Four times seven… twenty‑eight.

“Four sharps! At E major, four sharps gather!” he shouted, just in time.

---

The Priest smiled thinly. “You are sharp yourself. The audition is over. We have found our deacon!”

---

In the days that followed, the Priest gave the boy a careful tour of the Temple: the archives of the Twelve Notes, the cloisters where chants rose in unison, and, at last, a locked door he had not opened in years. He meant only to pass it by — but the boy’s curiosity outweighed propriety.

They stepped into a circular chamber. The floor was inlaid with broad brass rings, the walls traced with faded sigils. The moment the boy crossed the threshold, the metal beneath their feet vibrated — answering the soft rhythm that kept time on his wrist.

The Priest froze. No one remembered how to enter the note‑realms. The way had been lost for generations.

Before he could speak, the boy blinked out of sight.

---

When he reappeared, flushed and unsettled, his words tumbled out — fragments of a strange, self‑contained world, its sky filled with the voice of a single note, bordered on two sides by unseen neighbours he could not name.

The Priest, servant of the Twelve yet ignorant of their hidden order, listened with mounting gravity.

“The way to the realms is all but forgotten,” he said, pressing a satchel of parchment and ink into the boy’s hands. “Only you have crossed their thresholds. Go again. Visit every world you can reach. Chart them all. Through you alone may we learn how each realm of notes touches another.”

---

Two months later, the chamber’s rings sang once more. The boy returned, travel‑stained, laying out scroll after scroll.

“They’re tiny worlds,” he said. “Each knows only itself… and the two voices it can see before it — the ones it can support and harmonise with. Yet from behind come the unseen two that support it in turn, and sometimes their distant call stirs it to join.”

The Priest looked down at the maps — fragments of a greater constellation — and knew the long‑forgotten design of music was beginning to surface.

The boy studied them in silence, then lifted his gaze. “Give me a few days,” he said. “I think I can join them.”

The Priest agreed, and the boy vanished into the quiet of the scriptorium. For three days and nights he worked, aligning each realm’s borders, bending their edges until they met without tearing. He shaped the joins from deep black onyx, smooth as still water, each joint a solid anchor between worlds — yet in truth, no two were alike. Within their glossy depths shimmered twelve distinct hues, each drawn from a different point along the great circle of colour, the whole spectrum divided evenly as if by some unseen, harmonic law. From every joint began not one but two paths — a slender curve of brushed grey metal arcing toward a neighbour, and a straight edge flowing in calm precision toward the next point. Each curve and each edge shared the same hue as the onyx joint from which it sprang, the twelve colours spaced evenly around the great circle of light, so that form and spectrum moved together in perfect accord. The twelve curves wound together into a single, closed helix twisting through space, while the twelve straight edges bound themselves into four poised triangles that floated within the form, giving it both structure and hidden symmetry.

On the morning of the fourth day, he carried his work into the circular chamber. It was no flat chart, but a living form: a ring — or perhaps a twisted torus — that seemed to turn in on itself, its onyx nodes and metal curves breathing in the dim light. Here, for the first time, the Twelve were bound together in one continuous shape, each note touching its neighbours, the whole singing in silent geometry.

The Priest circled it slowly, awe in his eyes. “This,” he said at last, “is the world of notes.”

The Priest was thrilled, utterly satisfied.  
“You never told me your last name, boy,” he said.  
“It is Cholidis, my holy Father.”  
“Then from now on — at least for me — I shall refer to this fine artifact as the *Cholidean Harmony Structure*.”

He laughed, and the boy joined in, perhaps a little awkwardly, taken aback by the unexpected — and perhaps somewhat excessive — recognition from the Priest.
