# 💡 Developer Integration Guide

This file outlines the geometric modeling pipeline, asset preparation steps, and Git subtree integrations used to build the **Cholidean Harmony Structure** — a spatial-musical framework rendered in Love2D using 3DreamEngine.

## 🧭 Geometry Design Pipeline

### Overview

This project visualizes harmonic relationships in 12-tone equal temperament (12ET) using parametric 3D geometry and dynamic rendering. Geometry generation and refinement are handled with OpenSCAD, MeshLab, Blender, and finally consumed by Love2D.

### Workflow

1. ✳️ **OpenSCAD**  
   - Scripts: `main.scad`, `prims.scad`  
   - Models parametric dodecahedra, joints, ribbon surfaces, and curves arranged in a toroidal helix.

2. 🎛️ **Export**  
   - Use `export_tones_and_surfaces.sh` to batch export `.stl` files.

3. 🧽 **MeshLab**  
   - Apply smoothing using `smoothing_objects.mlx` script.

4. 🎨 **Blender**  
   - Import `.obj` files (`Up Axis: Z`)  
   - Assign materials & HDRI (from [ambientCG](https://ambientcg.com/))  
   - Use `.hdr` backgrounds (converted from `.exr` via GIMP)  
   - For normals, `.png` files are used with `Roughness = 1`  
   - Export `.obj` files (`Up Axis: Y`)  
   - **Final Renaming for 3DreamEngine Compatibility:**  
     To allow correct asset linking and indexing inside the engine, all objects were renamed based on their tonal label following the **circle of perfect fourths**:
     ```
     joints_C      → joint_00
     edges_F       → edge_01
     curves_Bb     → curve_02
     surfaces_Eb   → surface_03
     ...
     ```
     This mapping continues cyclically for all 12 tones, assigning suffixes `00–11` and preserving type prefixes (`joint_`, `edge_`, `curve_`, `surface_`).
     Materials in textures/ subfolder of blender is copied in assets/materials_gl/materials/ subfolder and renamed accordingly with the exception that ...Color.png renamed as albedo.png

5. 🎮 **Love2D + 3DreamEngine**  
   - Load processed models and render with real-time shading and interactive behavior.

## 🎶 Harmony Structure Notes

- Each tone represented by a **dodecahedron** on a toroidal helix (Circle of Fourths)
- **Modulatory pathways** represented by curves and edges
- Entire system is parametric and customizable

## 📦 Git Subtree Integrations

To keep the project self-contained and updatable, key third-party libraries are included using Git subtrees.

### 3DreamEngine

🗂️ Paths:

*    Core: 3DreamEngine/3DreamEngine/

*    Extensions: 3DreamEngine/extensions/

#### 1 **Initial Integration** (Core)
```
git remote add -f 3DreamEngine https://github.com/3dreamengine/3DreamEngine.git
git fetch 3DreamEngine master
git merge -s ours --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories 3DreamEngine/master
git read-tree --prefix=3DreamEngine/ -u 3DreamEngine/master:3DreamEngine
git commit -m "Merge in 3DreamEngine subtree (upstream 3DreamEngine/ folder) into local 3DreamEngine/"
```
**Update** (Core)
```
git fetch 3DreamEngine master
git read-tree --prefix=3DreamEngine/ -u 3DreamEngine/master:3DreamEngine
git commit -m "Update 3DreamEngine core subtree"
```
#### 2 **Initial Integration** (Extensions)

```
git read-tree --prefix=extensions/ -u 3DreamEngine/master:extensions
git commit -m "Import 3DreamEngine extensions into root/extensions/"
```
**Update** (Extensions)
```
git fetch 3DreamEngine master
git read-tree --prefix=extensions/ -u 3DreamEngine/master:extensions
git commit -m "Update 3DreamEngine extensions subtree"
```

🧰 Tips for Development & Branching

   Use feature branches (e.g. insert_mats) to test integrations before merging to main

   All subtree operations should be committed with descriptive messages

   Always commit or stash local changes before running subtree pull

   From project's root directory, you can run
```    
    ./asset_pipeline/update-libs.sh
```
   to automate library updates. You’ll see the subtrees update, followed by the message:
   ✅ All subtrees updated and version log written to asset_pipeline/lib_versions.md

⚠️ Caution: Using Git LFS with an embedded 3DreamEngine can easily push your repository beyond 5 GB due to ~4+ GB of unnecessary history blobs. Review your workflow carefully—certain commands that add large binaries or rewrite history can trigger a data flood.
