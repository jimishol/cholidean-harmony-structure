Thank you very much for your reply dear Edgar

While I was waiting your reply I started to create a demo from scratch, of course with the help if AI because my knowledge are limited. So, I started with luamidi, luajit, g3d, cpml till the point to see the spiral of fifths. But something went wrong with the compatibility or versions of luajit related to others. On my side, I am completely absorbed with that project. Now i am trying the same with luamidi, love2d and 3DreamEngine with their libraries embedded so one would have to install only love2d.
I totally appreciate the link to contact Professor Thomas Fiore and I will definitely do. I will wait though for few days because i am convinced that the  demo is doable by me and would be better to contact  that demo too. It is not ready to by uploaded as repository on github. I will upload when it somehow works or when i am desperate for help. I am sure you will help if you can, there is no need to reply declaring your given support and I thank you for that.

For any news about my development or Professor Thomas Fiore I will email you.

Thank you very much dear Edgar
you managed to involve me in the wonderful world of harmony and maths and developing once again!
