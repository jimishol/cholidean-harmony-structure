# Cholidean Harmony Structure

Cholidean Harmony Structure is a projection of 12-tone equal temperament [12ET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_equal_temperament) music systems into 3D space. The tones are placed on a 3D parametric closed curve. The fact that each tone is related to two and only two other tones, creates strongly the perception of a two-dimensional surface strip that curves in three-dimensional space to fit the surface of an [umbilic torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbilic_torus).


Project's integration with [FluidSynth](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth), as a MIDI backend player, demonstrates a powerful method for visualizing and exploring harmony theories.

## Installation Prerequisites and Steps üöÄ

This project is built with L√ñVE [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) and uses FluidSynth for MIDI playback. It runs best on Linux, but Windows support is straightforward. macOS is untested, though basic usage may work.

---

### üêß Linux

If you're on Linux and have not L√ñVE installed,
```
sudo zypper install love
```

Running, from project's ROOT directory, is simple:
```
love .
```
or
```
./run.sh
```
 in order to have restart capability.

To enable MIDI playback, install FluidSynth via your package manager:
```
sudo zypper install fluidsynth
```
Then download the SoundFont `FluidR3_GM.sf2` from:
https://github.com/Jacalz/fluid-soundfont/blob/master/original-files/FluidR3_GM.sf2  
(use ‚ÄúDownload raw file‚Äù) and place it in project's root or better install them, if your repository include them,
```
sudo zypper install fluid-soundfont-gm
```
There is no need to place sounfonts in project's root in that case.

### üçé macOS (Untested)

L√ñVE and FluidSynth are available via Homebrew:

brew install love  
brew install fluidsynth

You can try running the project with:

love .

Note: macOS support is currently unverified. This project was built with love and determination by a non-developer, with lots of trial, error, and A.I. guidance. Contributions or feedback from macOS users‚Äîespecially developers‚Äîare warmly welcomed to help improve compatibility and ease of use.

### ü™ü Windows

Before running the project on Windows, make sure you have a machine or VM with real GPU support, 3D acceleration, and OpenGL enabled. 

1. **Prepare the Project Directory**  
   - Clone (if you want asset_pipeline and/or docs floder) or Download release zip (e.g. `cholidean-harmony-structure-0.1.2-alpha.zip`).  
   - Unzip it anywhere you like, for example:  
     C:\Users\<YourUsername>\  

2. **Install L√ñVE (Love2D)**  
   - Visit https://love2d.org/ and Download the Windows zip (portable version).  
   - Unzip to a folder of your choice, for example:  
     C:\Users\<YourUsername>\
   - Move all contents of L√ñVE folder (after all you can recreate them from the .zip file) into Project's Directory.  
   - After this step, `main.lua`, `conf.lua`, and any other project assets should sit next to `love.exe`.

3. **Install FluidSynth**  
     Download the binaries  
      - Go to https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/releases and grab the latest Windows zip.  
      - Unzip it into Project's Directory (same place as `main.lua`). This will create `lib\`, `include\`, and `bin\`subfolders in it.

4. **Add SoundFonts**  
   - FluidSynth doesn‚Äôt ship with a default SoundFont.  
   - Download `FluidR3_GM.sf2` from:  
     https://github.com/Jacalz/fluid-soundfont/blob/master/original-files/FluidR3_GM.sf2  
     (use ‚ÄúDownload raw file‚Äù)  
   - Place `FluidR3_GM.sf2` in Project's Directory (next to `main.lua`).

5. **Install Git for Windows (a necessity for winpty)**  
   - Download Git for Windows from https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases (e.g. `v2.50.1.windows.1`). Scroll down to find assets and pick the latest installer.
    
   - Install and reboot your machine.  
  
   - Launch the game by
   
6.  **Double Click** on **run.bat** file.



**Known Issue:**

‚ö†Ô∏è Windows‚Äëspecific notes

* No spaces in song filenames ‚Äî The current backend passes song paths directly to FluidSynth under Bash. On Windows, spaces in filenames can break playback due to how arguments are parsed through the winpty layer. Please rename files or use underscores instead. (Example: My Song.mid ‚Üí My_Song.mid)

* Restart-on-exit is disabled ‚Äî On Linux/macOS, exiting with code 42 will automatically restart the game. On Windows, the winpty compatibility layer does not return non‚Äëzero exit codes to the batch wrapper, so this feature isn‚Äôt currently supported.

## Prerequisites

If you haven‚Äôt already installed the project via Releases, this project uses Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage assets (normal maps, textures, etc.). Before you clone, build, or contribute, make sure Git LFS is installed and initialized:

```bash
# Install Git LFS (once per machine):

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install git-lfs

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install git-lfs

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install git-lfs

# Initialize Git LFS
git lfs install
```

## Acknowledgments üôè

This project took shape thanks to the insight and encouragement of [**E.... D...... V...**](https://github.com/USERNAME).

Although the idea had been explored by 20th‚Äëcentury music‚Äìmath theorists, it was only when E.D.V. encountered the concept that he immediately recognized its potential for new approaches in 12ET harmony. He urged me to share it more widely and encouraged me to bring it into academic and creative circles. 

That encouragement transformed a dormant idea into a living project. From OpenSCAD to MeshLab, to Blender, to 3DreamEngine, to MIDI events, each stage brought new challenges and discoveries. Without E.D.V.‚Äôs vision and determination, this journey might never have begun.
