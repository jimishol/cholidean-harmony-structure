## Installation Prerequisites and Steps üöÄ

This project is built with L√ñVE (Love2D) and uses FluidSynth for MIDI playback. It runs best on Linux, but Windows support is straightforward. macOS is untested, though basic usage may work.

---

### üêß Linux

If you're on Linux and have L√ñVE installed, running the project is simple:

love .

To enable MIDI playback, install FluidSynth via your package manager:

sudo apt-get install fluidsynth

Then download the SoundFont `FluidR3_GM.sf2` from:
https://github.com/Jacalz/fluid-soundfont/blob/master/original-files/FluidR3_GM.sf2  
(use ‚ÄúDownload raw file‚Äù) and place it in your project root.

---

### üçé macOS (Untested)

L√ñVE and FluidSynth are available via Homebrew:

brew install love  
brew install fluidsynth

You can try running the project with:

love .

Note: macOS support is currently unverified. This project was built with love and determination by a non-developer, with lots of trial, error, and guidance. Contributions or feedback from macOS users‚Äîespecially developers‚Äîare warmly welcomed to help improve compatibility and ease of use.

### ü™ü Windows

Before running the project on Windows, make sure you have a machine or VM with real GPU support, 3D acceleration, and OpenGL enabled. Without hardware acceleration, you‚Äôll encounter a black screen and no audio output.

1. **Install L√ñVE (Love2D)**  
   - Visit https://love2d.org/ and download the Windows zip (portable version).  
   - Unzip to a folder of your choice, for example:  
     C:\Users\<YourUsername>\love-11.5-win64  
   - You should now have `love.exe` alongside folders like `love-11.5-win64\`.

2. **Prepare the Project Directory**  
   - Download or clone your project release zip (e.g. `cholidean-harmony-structure-0.1.0-alpha.zip`).  
   - Unzip it anywhere you like, for example:  
     C:\Users\<YourUsername>\cholidean-harmony-structure-0.1.0-alpha  
   - Copy all project files (including `main.lua`) into the same folder where `love.exe` lives:  
     C:\Users\<YourUsername>\love-11.5-win64\  
   - After this step, `main.lua`, `conf.lua`, and any other project assets should sit next to `love.exe`.

3. **Install FluidSynth**  
   3.1 Download the binaries  
       - Go to https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/releases and grab the latest Windows zip.  
       - Unzip it into your project folder (same place as `main.lua`), creating subfolders `lib\`, `include\`, and `bin\`.

   3.2 Configure the backend path  
       - Open `constants.lua` in your project and set:  
         M.windowsBackendPath = "bin//"
       - You can run `bin/fluidsynth.exe` manually (e.g. `fluidsynth.exe --help`) to verify it works.

4. **Add SoundFonts**  
   - FluidSynth doesn‚Äôt ship with a default SoundFont.  
   - Download `FluidR3_GM.sf2` from:  
     https://github.com/Jacalz/fluid-soundfont/blob/master/original-files/FluidR3_GM.sf2  
     (use ‚ÄúDownload raw file‚Äù)  
   - Place `FluidR3_GM.sf2` in your project root (next to `main.lua`).

5. **Install Git for Windows (a necessity for winpty)**  
   - Download Git for Windows from https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases (e.g. `v2.50.1.windows.1`).  
   - Install and reboot your machine.  
   - Open **Git Bash**, cd into your L√ñVE folder:  
     cd /c/Users/<YourUsername>/love-11.5-win64  
   - Launch the game with console output enabled:  
     ./love.exe --console .

   - You should see no errors in the console, and keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+Q will work to quit.

**Known Issue:**  
In a VM without proper GPU passthrough or 3D acceleration, you will get a black screen and no sound. For full functionality, test on a physical Windows machine or in a VM configured with a dedicated GPU.

## Prerequisites

If you haven‚Äôt already installed the project via Releases, this project uses Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage assets (normal maps, textures, etc.). Before you clone, build, or contribute, make sure Git LFS is installed and initialized:

```bash
# Install Git LFS (once per machine):

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install git-lfs

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install git-lfs

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install git-lfs

# Initialize Git LFS
git lfs install
```
